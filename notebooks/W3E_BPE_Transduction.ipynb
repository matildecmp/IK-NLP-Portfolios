        "The [Tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/quicktour.html) library by Huggingface provides implementations of today’s most used tokenizers (especially subword-based ones) that is both easy to use and blazing fast (Rust-compiled code!).\n",
        "\n",
        "You will start by exploring the impact of different vocabulary sizes on a subword tokenizer using the Tokenizers library, and how these can be imported and used with spaCy. Finally, you will be asked to train a small transformer model to perform transduction from feminine to masculine words.\n",

        "Exercise 1 is mandatory and will be part of your graded midterm portfolio. Exercise 2 is optional, but we highly recommend you to complete it, especially if you're interested in the \"Modern Neural Networks meet Linguistic Theory\" final project.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the following exercise, we will use a byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer (see Jurafsky & Martin Sec. 2.4.3 and [Sennich et al, 2015](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1162/) to create a vocabulary of frequent words and subwords, allowing us to handle less frequent words.\n",

        "\n",
        "The following code loads a BPE tokenizer and trainer, tells the system to use whitespace as a separator and defines `[UNK]` as a special token intended to handle unknown words."
