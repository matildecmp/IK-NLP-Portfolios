This class converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of [TF-IDF scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) reflecting the importance of a word in a document, and in relation to the full corpus. We are going to set some parameters to ensure a limited size of the vocabulary, but you can experiment with other values."

Luckily, the [`OneHotEncoder`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) class is readily available in Scikit-learn for this purpose. An even more convenient approach is to use the [`pandas.get_dummies`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html) function, which returns a pandas Dataframe with labeled one-hot encoded columns,"
