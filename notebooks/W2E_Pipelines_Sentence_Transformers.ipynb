The model uses both the right and left context of the masked position to make its predictions. Models trained to maximize the probability of predicting the correct masked words learn to represent a good amount of linguistic knowledge as a result of this.\n",

In the example above, for instance, the masked position can be filled by a plural noun (*problems*) but not by a singular noun (*problem*). If the model makes predictions that respect the linguistic constraints, we have reason to believe that the model is somehow aware of the linguistic structure of the language.\n",

There is a host of literature on this, see for instance [Marvin and Linzen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09031) (for English) and [Sahin et al](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/coli_a_00376) (for multilingual probes).\n",
